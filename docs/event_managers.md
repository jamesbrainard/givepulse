## View Phone Numbers for Weekly Service
Viewing phone numbers for weekly service is more complicated than it seems - this is because the "Phone number" data that GivePulse keeps track of is tied to the user's account, whereas phone numbers collected from custom response fields (when a user registers) are hidden in event-specific registration pages.

#### Walkthrough
1. Click Manage -> Events in the top right corner

2. Click on your user icon and click "Switch to Classic" - your screen should now look like this:

5. Clicking on the "Configure Layout" button will bring up a large list of data columns - scroll down until you find BOTH of the "Phone Number" options and select both of them. *Be sure to click apply!*
